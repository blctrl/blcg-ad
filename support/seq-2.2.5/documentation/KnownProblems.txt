Known Problems
==============

.. _Known_Problems_2.2.4:

Known Problems in Release 2.2.4
-------------------------------

* Building fails with Visual Studio 2010 due to a C99-ism (mixed
  declarations and code) that was introduced when upgrading the lemon parser
  template.

* Parallel building can fail when using gcc to generate dependency information.
  The solution is to use the EPICS tool mkmf.pl instead by placing a line

    HDEPENDS_METHOD = MKMF

  in the config section of src/snc/Makefile.

* On Windows, ``make clean`` fails inside the documentation directory. The
  fix is to replace ``rm -rf`` with ``$(RMDIR)`` in documentation/Makefile.

.. _Known_Problems_2.2.3:

Known Problems in Release 2.2.3
-------------------------------

* Certain versions of Windows don't like relative paths with forward slashes
  for commands whose result gets redirected to a file. This leads to errors
  when building against base-3.15 which has deprecated the ``PATH_FILTER``
  function (which converts forward to backward slashes). The solution is to
  define ``LEMON=$(abspath $(INSTALL_HOST_BIN)/lemon$(HOSTEXE))`` in
  ``src/snc/Makefile``.

.. _Known_Problems_2.2.2:

Known Problems in Release 2.2.2
-------------------------------

* Attempting to issue a DEFAULT pvPut when an ASYNC put is already
  pending on the same variable leads to an assertion failure.

.. _Known_Problems_2.2.1:

Known Problems in Release 2.2.1
-------------------------------

* In test/validate, pvAssignStress.st has the same program name as
  pvAssignSubst.st, leading to build errors when cross-compiling to VxWorks
  or RTEMS, where all tests get linked into a single library. This can be
  fixed by changing the program name in pvAssignStress.st to
  "pvAssignStressTest".

* A previous bugfix in the pvAssign builtin introduced a regression, that
  can lead to assertion failures.

* A wrong assertion in the CA event handler may be triggered when connection
  to a PV is lost in the middle of a pending get request.

* When exiting from a program, deadlock is possible when a pending callback
  is active when the program shuts down.

* Tests fail in tests/compiler if the build host has an ancient version of
  Test::More that does not support subtest. This happens e.g. on RHEL 6.6.

* Dependency generation in src/snc is broken if compiled against base-3.15
  due to a bug in the Makefile (and one in base).

* Building static libraries fails due to wrong order of dependent libraries
  in two Makefiles.

* Building on Windows can fail due to missing epicsShare stuff in seq_snc.h.
