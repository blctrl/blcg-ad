Release Notes for Version 2.2
=============================

.. _Release_Notes_2.2.5:

Release 2.2.5
-------------

* docs: use RMDIR instead of rm -rf for clean target in the Makefile

  This fixes (harmless but annoying) error messages on Windows.

* snc: use mkmf.pl to generate the dependencies

  This fixes error messages and sometimes also build failures during parallel
  builds on Linux machines iwth many cores. These are caused by EPICS build
  rules not passing -MD to gcc when generating dependencies for C source files.

* snc: fixed C90 incompatibility in the parser template, see :ref:`Known_Problems_2.2.4`.


.. _Release_Notes_2.2.4:

Release 2.2.4
-------------

code:

* seq: fixed a possible race condition with pvAssign

  The problem concerns access to the dbch member of CHAN: the runtime pvAssign
  may free this pointer (and also sets it to NULL); on the other hand, the CA
  callbacks need to access it, or else must return immediately. There was a
  test that checks if dbch is NULL but it was not locked against concurrent
  access from pvAssign, which could lead to an assertion failure or worse to
  invalid memory accesses.

* seq: in pvFlushQ test that queue and associated event flag of the channel
  actually exist before accessing them.

  This fixes possible crashes when using this function with non-queued or
  queued but non-synced channels.

* pv: fix test for result of epicsTimeGetCurrent

  This change fixes a problem with EPICS base-3.16, which adds more error
  codes to epicsTime.

* lemon: updated lemon.c and the parser template from upstream

  This was done to avoid 64 bit problems that the native Windows compiler
  warned about, since such problems are usually handled quite efficiently by
  the sqlite maintainers. Unfortunately the latest version of the parser
  template had a serious bug that could result in compiler crashes. This bug
  has been fixed in the sequencer (and reported, but not yet fixed, in the
  upstream version). This in turn uncovered a weakness in the compiler
  tests, see below.

docs:

* fixed errors in section "Asynchronous Use of pvPut" of tutorial

  Thanks to Christian Pulvermacher <christian.pulvermacher@kek.jp> for
  spotting this.

build system:

* snc: turn LEMON into an absolute path with base 3.15

  This fixes a build problem on some Windows versions which don't like
  relative path names for commands when the output is redirected to a file.

* snc: extra dependency avoids (harmless) errors when generating .d files

* snc: simplify the multi-target lemon rule

  Instead of generating an intermediate file ("parser_created") we now use a
  pattern rule. This is the more reliable (and recommended) way to make rules
  with multiple targets work as expected.

* test only for BASE_3_14==YES

  Testing for 3.15 doesn't make sense (yet), as the majority of changes
  will be needed for 3.16 and later versions, too. Testing BASE_3_15==YES
  will be reserved for incompatibilities between 3.15 and 3.16 etc.

* avoid deprecation warnings for use of PATH_FILTER with base 3.15

* snc: make recipe for snl.bnf atomic

test/examples:

* moved test for invalid state change statement to compiler tests

* moved demo programs from test/validate to examples/small

  The programs are only compiled as TESTPROD_HOST to avoid cluttering the
  install directories any further; db files can be served using the standard
  softIoc binary from base.

* added timer.st to examples

* refactor killing background IOCs

* test that snc terminates normally on all input programs

  Previously, in case snc crashes on some input file, it was possible that
  this was not detected by the tests.


.. _Release_Notes_2.2.3:

Release 2.2.3
-------------

Thanks to the new co-maintainer Freddie Akeroyd <freddie.akeroyd@stfc.ac.uk>
this release fixes building and running the tests for Windows7 in 32 and 64
bit, both with cygwin and native compiler. Please note that parallel building
may not work on Windows yet.

A few bugs have been fixed and some minor improvements made here or there,
for details see the list below.

snc:

* cast 0 to Node* in varargs call to node constructor

* added a missing include to types.h

* explain apparently missing var init in a comment

* fix warnings and error when DEBUG is defined

seq:

* Initialise timeNow

  Required for running tests with windows debug build

* fix default put during a pending async put

  Attempting to issue a DEFAULT pvPut even when an ASYNC put is already
  pending on the same variable led to an assertion failure. This is now fixed.

common:

* cleaned up the prim_types mess, snc no longer depends on seq library

  Making the compiler depend on the seq library was a bad idea, since the
  names of the primitive types were the only thing that snc needed from seq.

  Instead I added a new src/common subdir that installs (and for seq_release.h
  generates) the header files that are shared between the compiler and the
  runtime. The epicsShare stuff has been removed from seq_prim_types.h. A new
  preprocessor symbol (declare_prim_type_names) makes sure that the
  prim_type_name and prim_type_tag_name variables are visible only inside the
  runtime library and the compiler and not  in generated sequencer programs.

test:

* Set PATH for running tests in shared build

  The path to seq.dll needs to be set in cygwin and Windows for running
  tests when built with SHARED_LIBRARIES=YES

* Fix running tests on Windows

  The \*Ioc.t tests were hanging on windows when run from Make - they
  worked when ran individually from the command line, but were not then
  killing the background IOC process on test completion. Using the
  Win32::Process package rather than fork() to create subprocesses fixes
  both issues

* set environment variables in a more portable way

* silence warnings about different TOP dirs

* ensure that tests cover seq exit phase

* Reorder test linking for cygwin

  Move subThreadSleep.c to separate library to enable correct import/export
  declarations for linking on cygwin

* enable pvSync with or without db

* set HARNESS_ACTIVE env var in queueTest.plt

* use a per host "unique" CA server port

  The idea here is to isolate concurrent test runs on the same machine against
  each other. The port is set to 10000 + pid % 30000, which is not unique in a
  strict sense, but the probability of a collision is quite small and the
  solution is non-intrusive and very simple to implement.

examples/demo:

* link specific code into a library instead of main

  This fixes problems for cygwin-x86 arch.

build system:

* added include of meta build configuration to configure/RELEASE

* removed configure/RELEASE.win32-x86


.. _Release_Notes_2.2.2:

Release 2.2.2
-------------

The bugs listed in `Known_Problems_2.2.1` have been fixed.

In addition, some of the tests and parts of the test infrastructure have
been changed so as to produce clean TAP files (this is currently only
supported by base-3.15 with 'make tapfiles'). For the same reason, the usual
messages when a program starts are no longer issued with printf, but rather
with errlogSevPrintf(errlogInfo,...).

Some improvements to the web pages have been made: the version the pages
refer to is more prominently visible, some shortcuts have been renamed, and
side-bar shortcuts to all other (maintained) versions were added.

I added git mirrors of the darcs repos, the URLs are:

http://www-csr.bessy.de/control/SoftDist/sequencer/repo/branch-2-1.git
http://www-csr.bessy.de/control/SoftDist/sequencer/repo/branch-2-2.git
http://www-csr.bessy.de/control/SoftDist/sequencer/repo/branch-2-3.git

.. _Release_Notes_2.2.1:

Release 2.2.1
-------------

This is the first release of version 2.2 of the sequencer. The following
describes what has changed relative to version 2.1.

Supported EPICS Base Versions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This version drops support for base versions older than 3.14.12.2, all
others should work fine.

If you manage to compile the sequencer with earlier base versions, well,
good for you. It'll probably work, too. I will also accept patches that
restore lost compatibility with older base versions, provided they achieve
this without unduly complicating the code base or build system.

New Language Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Foreign Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is now possible to use foreign types (i.e. types declared in C code, such
as structs, enums, unions, and typedefs) in variable declarations, type
casts, and the special "sizeof" built-in operator. Previously existing
restrictions as to which type expressions are allowed have been lifted, so
that (almost) everything you can say in C is now supported in SNL, too.
Particularly, function types are now supported in declarations and type
expressions, as well as indirect calls in expressions.

There are two notable limitations:

* Using C *type aliases* (defined in C with ``typedef``) is allowed, but you
  must prefix the type name with the new keyword ``typename`` (which I
  borrowed from C++). Supporting foreign typedefs without any extra markup
  as in C would require lots of extra effort which IMO is not justified.

* There is only limited support for *defining* your own types (see `Type
  Definitions`_ below) and you cannot mix type definition with type usage
  (for instance in a variable declaration) as in C.

The words ``enum``, ``struct``, ``typename``, ``union``, and ``void`` are
reserved words now and can no longer be used as identifiers.

Other Foreign Entities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A side effect of allowing indirect calls is that there is no longer any
*syntactic* distinction between using functions and using variables. This
means that issuing warnings just for the use of undeclared foreign
*variables* is no longer possible. If they are still undeclared in the
generated C code, the C compiler will warn you anyway. You can enable extra
warnings (`+W`, see `New Option for Extra Warnings`_ below) to get
these warnings, but that will report foreign functions, too.

A related change is that struct or union members are no longer identified
with variables in the SNL syntax; members are no longer considered to be
foreign entities (but for compatibility you can still list them in a foreign
declaration).

Function Definitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can now define functions in SNL. The syntax is like in C and you *can*
call the built-in PV functions inside them. This is made possible by passing
the execution context (the state set identifier and the variable block
pointer) as hidden parameters.

You may pass all kinds of variables to such a function, but for channel
("assigned") variables their special "assigned" status gets lost when
passing them, similar as when passing them to a C function. This means you
can call e.g. pvGet(x) in the body of an SNL function, but only if x is a
global variable.

My various attempts to lift this limitation were the main reason it took me
so much longer than I had expected to make this release. In order not to
hold up the release of version 2.2 any longer, I decided to postpone this
feature to a future release.

Type Definitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can now define your own struct types in SNL (other type formers like
union and enum are not yet supported). As usual the syntax is a (simplified:
no bit fields) variant of the C syntax. This is currently not very useful,
since there is no way to "assign" struct members to PVs. Lifting this
limitation is closely related to passing channel arguments to functions and
therefore postponed, too.

New Option for Extra Warnings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The new option:`+W` (off by default) enables extra warnings, that you
normally don't want to see. Currently this warns you once for each foreign
entity that appears in the program.


Deprecated and Removed Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Deprecated Foreign Declarations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The so called "foreign entity declarations", introduced in version 2.1, have
become obsolete (see `Other Foreign Entities`_) and are therefore
*deprecated*.

Deprecated State Local ``assign`` etc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using an `assign`, `monitor`, `sync`, or `syncq` clause inside a state is
now deprecated. This was never very useful to begin with, and gets in the
way of some future improvements.

Removed Keyword "connect"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This alias for the "assign" keyword, also introduced in version 2.1, is no
longer supported. I believe nobody actually uses it, and the next version
will introduce a completely new syntax for that feature anyway. I can demote
the removal to a deprecation warning if it turns out that this seriously
hurts people.

With hindsight, introducing this was a bad idea, as were foreign
declarations and state local assign.

Removed PV Library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The PV library has been almost completely eliminated. What remains is a thin
layer over CA, implemented in C, and offering only the functionality that is
actually needed by the sequencer. The API is similar (but not identical) to
the old C API; particularly, all the pvStat, pvSevr, and pvType definitions
are as before.

The documentation for the PV layer has been removed, too. The only remaining
user relevant part of the interface is contained in pvAlarm.h, see
`Built-in Constants`_.

Also removed were the Keck examples and the KTL related stuff in other example
directories.

Removed devSequencer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The (broken and ugly) sequencer device support was removed.
Consequently, seqFindProgByName was be removed as it is no longer needed.


Built-in Constants
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All built-in constants are now known to `snc` and therefore no longer
treated as foreign entities. Particularly, using them no longer gives
"undefined variable" warnings, even with extra warnings enabled
(`+W`). They are also documented in the reference.

The *snc*-generated C code for built-in constants now uses the name of the
constant, instead of its value. This makes the code a bit more readable and
slightly simplifies code generation.

The variables ``ssId`` and ``pVar`` are (somewhat irregularly) treated as
built-in constants, too. This makes it possible to call C functions that
take them as a parameter directly from inside SNL code without having to
escape the call. That is, you can now write such calls as ::

  my_c_fun(ssId, pVar, ...);

instead of ::

  %%my_c_fun(ssId, pVar, ...);


Built-in Functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Reported Severity of Failures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The severity of timeouts and usage errors reported on the console has been
demoted from ``errlogFatal`` to ``errlogMajor``. Reporting them as fatal has
misled users in the past to think that their running program instances have
become unstable now, which is definitely not the case for this sort of
errors.

pvMessage
~~~~~~~~~

The built-in function `pvMessage` now consistently returns a failure string
describing the problem whenever anything with the passed channel variable
went wrong. This particularly applies to any failure status returned from
the CA layer.

New Delay Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While it was always *allowed* to use arbitrary SNL expressions for the
argument to `delay`, even expressions that could change their value
at any time (e.g. because they contain monitored variables), this did *not*
work as one would expect. In fact, the delay expression would be evaluated
just once for all delays appearing in conditions inside a state when the
state was entered. Later checks whether the delay has expired used the
cached delay value.

In the new (much simpler) implementation, delay expressions are evaluated
like all other parts of the state transition condition. Delay IDs no longer
exist and the code generator treats calls to delay like any other built-in
function. The effect of delaying the state transition is now achieved
(completely internal to the implementation of seq_delay) by adjusting the
minimum time to wait for events (if the delay has not yet expired). The
run-time system no longer stores the delay, but rather the (future) time
when the wake-up should happen, leading to more accurate timing of delays.

Since calling delay outside of the condition of a state transition never had
any useful effect, it is now disallowed.

.. note::

  The prototype of the underlying C function seq_delay() has changed to
  support the new implementation. If there is code out there which calls
  this function from the C side, I'd venture that it is broken anyway and
  should be fixed.


pvAssignSubst
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unlike the `assign` clause, the dynamic `pvAssign` function does not
substitute program parameters (previously sometimes referred to as "macros")
in the channel name. There is now a new function `pvAssignSubst` that
behaves exactly like `pvAssign` except that it substitutes program
parameters in the channel name, just like `assign` does.

PV Functions and Multiply Assigned Arrays
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A long time wart of the sequencer, inherited from the 2.0 version, was the
behaviour of built-in PV functions when you pass an array in which elements
are assigned to separate PVs. In most cases (except one, see below) this
behaved as if you had passed in just the first element of the array, which
is inconsistent and error-prone.

However, existing programs might (perhaps without the author or maintainer
being aware of it) rely on the current behaviour -- and silently breaking
such programs seems like a bad idea. Instead, this is now a *compile time
error*. The error message contains a hint how the user can fix their program
("perhaps you meant to pass xxx[0]?") so that it retains its old behaviour.

For some of the PV functions, operating on all contained PVs of a multi-PV
array would make sense if one would be willing to overload them. I decided
against that and instead provide a number of new functions named
"pvArray...":

* `pvArrayGetComplete`
* `pvArrayMonitor`
* `pvArrayPutComplete`
* `pvArrayStopMonitor`
* `pvArraySync`
* `pvArrayConnected`

I may add ``pvArrayGet`` and ``pvArrayPut`` in the future. Especially for
the `SYNC<compType>` variant, such functions could be implemented (much)
more efficiently than the semantically equivalent loop over all elements of
the array.

.. note::

  The C side equivalents seq_pvArray... are not (yet) part of the public
  API. The reason is that in version 2.3 they will get a slightly different
  type. You can use them in embedded C code but if you do that you should be
  aware that your program might not work or even build with version 2.3.

Timeout Arguments for pvGet and pvPut
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For both `pvGet` and `pvPut` there is now the possibility to
specify a timeout that differs from the default of 10 seconds. This is done
by giving an extra argument after the ``SYNC`` keyword, as in::

  pvGet(var,SYNC,1.0);

As before, the default behaviour for ``pvGet(var)`` i.e. neither an explicit
``SYNC`` nor ``ASYNC``, is synchronous, unless option `-a` is in
effect. In this case, or if ``SYNC`` is given with no extra argument, the
standard default timeout of 10 seconds is assumed.

In contrast to previous releases of version 2.2, the C equivalents are
unchanged with respect to version 2.1. Instead, the compiler generates calls
to ``seq_pvGetTmo`` or ``seq_pvPutTmo`` which have the additional argument.

New Built-in Functions pvGetCancel and pvPutCancel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is now possible to cancel and asynchronous get or put request by calling
`pvGetCancel` or `pvPutCancel`, or the channel array variants
`pvArrayGetCancel` or `pvArrayPutCancel`, respectively.


Generated C Code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Order of Definitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first change here is that the generated variable block is now placed
*after* all other top-level definitions that appear in the program before
the first state set, in particular before escaped C code. In previous
versions, this was the other way around. The second change is that for all
other top-level definitions the order is retained exactly as in the SNL
source file.

This was done so that foreign type declarations can be used in global (SNL)
variable declarations. This concerns types imported via ``%%#include``
as well as types defined in escaped C code.

Note that this means that escaped C code that appears before the first state
set cannot access global variables declared in SNL, even if the re-entrant
option is not in effect. Such C code should now be placed after the last
state set.

Anyway, it is my hope that the possibility to write functions directly in
SNL will make the escape-to-C route mostly obsolete.


Names of Generated Entities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These now follow a strict naming convention:

  Generated names start with ``seqg_``.

In particular, ``struct UserVar`` became ``struct seqg_var``, and the
implicit parameters ``ssId`` and ``pVar`` are now named ``seqg_ss`` and
``seqg_var``, respectively. Because these three identifiers are often
referenced in escaped C code, I have added compatibility aliases for them,
so as not to break existing programs. See `External API`_ below for details.

In order to prevent name clashes, words starting with ``seqg_`` are no longer
valid identifiers in SNL.

I am aware that there may be cases where this change breaks existing
programs which heavily rely on escape to C code. If this is the case, please
shout! Adding more compatibility aliases can be done any time.

Event Flags
~~~~~~~~~~~

The compiler now generates variables for event flags to make it easier for
escaped C code to call event flag functions (seq_ef*).


External API
^^^^^^^^^^^^

I finally got around to separating the public API (to be called from
e.g. embedded C code) from the internal interface between the compiler
generated code and the run-time system. The latter parts have been moved
from seqCom.h to the new header file seq_snc.h.

In particular, the following changes have been made:

Retained
~~~~~~~~

- includes of pvAlarm.h and seq_release.h

- enum compType and its members DEFAULT, ASYNC, SYNC

- constants NOEVFLAG and DEFAULT_QUEUE_SIZE

- typedefs string, SS_ID, seqBool, seqProgram

- all functions except seqRegisterSequencerProgram and seqRegisterSequencerCommands
  but including seq_pvIndex (which is actually a macro)

Added
~~~~~

- new built-in functions:

  + seq_pvGetCancel
  + seq_pvPutCancel
  + seq_pvAssignSubst

- the constant DEFAULT_TIMEOUT (see `New Delay Implementation`_)

Renamed
~~~~~~~

- EV_ID -> EF_ID
- VAR_ID -> CH_ID

Compatibility Aliases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

  typedef SEQ_VARS USER_VAR
  #define ssId                  seqg_ss
  #define pVar                  seqg_var
  #define USER_VAR              SEQ_VARS
  #define UserVar               seqg_vars
  #define VAR_ID                CH_ID
  #define EV_ID                 EF_ID
  #define seq_pvFreeQ           seq_pvFlushQ
  #define DEFAULT_QUEUE_SIZE    100

These names should not be used in new code.

Removed
~~~~~~~

- DELAY_ID (obsolete, see `New Delay Implementation`_)

- OPT_MAIN (-m is a compile time option)

- optTest (is now internal to seq library)

Moved to seq_snc.h
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- struct definitions for the static part of the generated program:

  + struct seqChan
  + struct seqState
  + struct seqSS
  + struct seqProgram
  + typedef PROG_ID

- option constants:

  + OPT_DEBUG
  + OPT_ASYNC
  + OPT_CONN
  + OPT_REENT
  + OPT_NEWEF
  + OPT_SAFE

  + OPT_NORESETTIMERS
  + OPT_DOENTRYFROMSELF
  + OPT_DOEXITTOSELF

  User code never needs to use these. It can use seq_optGet instead.

- bitmask operations:

  + NBITS
  + NWORDS
  + bitSet, bitClear, bitTest

  Like option values, these were never meant to be part of a public API.

- the constants TRUE and FALSE

- typedefs for generated functions; note that these have been renamed, too

- the functions seqRegisterSequencerProgram and seqRegisterSequencerCommands

Other Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- epicsShareAPI markers have been removed except for shell commands

Remarks
~~~~~~~

My justification for making these potentially breaking changes is that this
is how it should have been done from the start. The things I have removed
were never meant to be part of a public API. In the unlikely event that
there are existing programs with a legitimate need to access these
internals, they can always include seq_snc.h.


Build System
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Top-level Makefile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The extra rules in the top level Makefile to produce documentation with
or without generating a pdf file have been changed: 'pdf' and 'docs' are
no longer make variables. Instead there are a number of new targets you
can specify:

- html: build the docs in html format
- docs: additionally build the manual in pdf format
- upload etc: these are for my own benefit only, ignore them

See `Building the Manual` for details.

Generate st.d Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The extra build rules for the sequencer have been extended to generate
dependencies for .st files, using the mkmf.pl tool from base. Note that .st
files are passed through the C preprocessor and therefore may include C
header files or in fact SNL code from another file.


Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* Place program lock around wake-up commands in CA callback.

  This prevents a race condition resulting in a crash when the program
  shuts down and deletes mutexes etc before the callback has issued its
  final ss_wakeup call.

* Fixed connect and monitor accounting in seq_disconnect and seq_camonitor.
